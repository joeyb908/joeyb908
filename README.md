ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @joeyb908, aka Joey. I'm a 2x AWS certified teacher looking to change careers. Currently hold these certs:

     - AWS Developer Associate
     - AWS Solutions Architect Associate
     - AWS Cloud Practitioner
     - FTCE Mathematics K-12 (Math teaching certificate for Florida teachers)

ðŸ‘€ Here to check out what I've done? Check out my 100-days-of-code repository. I've accomplished quite a bit within the past month!

I'm interested in a whole range of things, from AWS and Python, to databases (SQL right now) and Git. I'm not really sure what 'position' title that would be a fit for, so I'm currently looking towards cloud engineer and DevOps roles. 

ðŸŒ± I've got a long way to go, but am making progress every day! Currently focused on the Developer Associate cert from AWS and learning Python.
